Beginner's game rendering engine built on libgdx

WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER

*TODO*
* Implement dragX and dragY (offset pos by initial touchpoint)
* Don't like the Viewport being passed in. We should change it.
* Have two stages, one for HUD. Sprites can be drawn on HUD layer instead. Useful for things like score.
* More effect samples
* Add Sprite methods queueEffect? loopEffect?
* Allow control over zOrder (relative methods like Sprite.putBehind(otherSprite))
* Provide a proper dispose() method which cleans everything out
* Make script dispose() and then restart at end after a tap
* Sprite mouse functions
* World size?
* Background drawing
* Debug grid overlay
* Look at gradle build
* Documentation - Move Javadoc out and turn it into Markdown documentation.
