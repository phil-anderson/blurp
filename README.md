Beginner's game rendering engine built on libgdx

WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER

*TODO*
* Fix issue with frequent fontSize changes causing jitters to TextSprites that should be stable
* Handle smaller Text better, and check small font sizing - Doesn't look right.
* Build list of all sprites to add to stage and add them in correct order so later ImageSprites are above earlier TextSprites etc.
* Add on-demand collision detection (text circular)
* Change moveTowards to take a step size in pixels - More intuitive!
* Implement Camera as a sprite
* World size?
* Effects factory with ability to poll for end of effect
* Background drawing
* Debug grid overlay
* Documentation - Move Javadoc out and turn it into Markdown documentation.
