Beginner's game rendering engine built on libgdx

WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER

*TODO*
* Console
* More effect samples
* RemoveAfterEffects
* Add Sprite methods queueEffect? loopEffect?
* Build list of all sprites to add to stage and add them in correct order so later ImageSprites are above earlier TextSprites etc.
* Allow control over zOrder (relative methods like Sprite.putBehind(otherSprite))
* Provide a proper dispose() method which cleans everything out
* Make script dispose() and then restart at end after a tap
* Sprite mouse functions
* Make Camera not effect HUD (e.g. Spencer's button)
* World size?
* Background drawing
* Debug grid overlay
* Look at gradle build
* Documentation - Move Javadoc out and turn it into Markdown documentation.
