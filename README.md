Beginner's game rendering engine built on libgdx

WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER

*TODO*
* Add on-demand collision detection (text circular)
* Change moveTowards to take a step size in pixels - More intuitive!
* Build list of all sprites to add to stage and add them in correct order so later ImageSprites are above earlier TextSprites etc.
* Provide a proper dispose() method which cleans everything out
* Make script dispose() and then restart at end after a tap
* Sprite mouse functions
* Implement Camera as a sprite
* World size?
* Effects factory with ability to poll for end of effect
* Background drawing
* Debug grid overlay
* Documentation - Move Javadoc out and turn it into Markdown documentation.
