* More effect samples
* RemoveAfterEffects
* Refactor so effect isn;t ap property but an action - playEffect maybe`
* Add Sprite methods queueEffect? loopEffect?
* Build list of all sprites to add to stage and add them in correct order so later ImageSprites are above earlier TextSprites etc.
* Allow control over zOrder (relative methods like Sprite.putBehind(otherSprite))
* Provide a proper dispose() method which cleans everything out
* Make script dispose() and then restart at end after a tap
* Sprite mouse functions
* Implement Camera as a sprite
* World size?
* Effects factory with ability to poll for end of effect
* Background drawing
* Debug grid overlay
