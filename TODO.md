# Todo List
* MINOR BUG - Very occasional stack trace on exit. Tighten up exit code to preclude any possible rendering.
* Use the Java Compiler API to compile .java files at runtime
* [DV] Ruby doesn't handle field remapping - method set_scale_x => setScaleX, but field scaleX !=> scale_x
* [DV] Need a Ruby wrapper that will check for camel-case properties if snake-case not found.
* [DV] Need a Ruby wrapper that will check for vanilla properties if ! or ? not found.
* [DV] Add sanity checks to model method parameters?
* [DV] Warm up script engine (mainly for JRuby)
* Look at gradle build, and add a task to create an executable jar
* Almost all examples need redoing / refactoring
* Documentation

* [DV] Image filename syntax for defining regions "spritesheet.png:x:y:w:h"
* [DV] Mouse - onMouseMoved, onLeftButtonPressed, onRightButtonPressed, onLeftButtonReleased, onRightButtonReleased
* [DV] NamedColour = Add to colourTag map on create, then user can create named colours too
* [DV] Blurp runtime should be a singleton.
* [DV] Provide a way to disable system shortcuts maybe?
* [DV] Sprite mouse left and right clicks
* [DV] Background drawing
* [DV] Shape Sprites (line, square, rect, circle, triangle, n-agon)
* [DV] Consider a SpriteList object that is a Sprite but changes propagate (D3 selector style)
* [DV] Move Viewport out of configuration and into BlurpStore.
* [DV] Have interfaces for properties like IPosition, IScale, IRotation. Then anything that has those can be used as a value in a setter. Mad idea?
